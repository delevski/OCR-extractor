# DeepSeek-OCR Installation Status

## Current Situation

The DeepSeek-OCR project has been successfully cloned and all setup files are ready. However, Python needs to be installed on your system before the project can run.

## What's Ready ‚úÖ

1. ‚úÖ Repository cloned from GitHub
2. ‚úÖ All source code downloaded
3. ‚úÖ Setup scripts created:
   - `QUICKSTART.md` - Quick start guide
   - `README_SETUP.md` - Detailed instructions
   - `INSTALL_PYTHON.md` - Python installation guide
   - `setup_and_run.sh` - Automated setup
   - `run_simple_test.py` - Test script

## What's Missing ‚ùå

- Python is not installed or not accessible
- Xcode license needs to be accepted
- Admin permissions required for installation

## What You Need To Do

### Option 1: Accept Xcode License (Quickest)

Open Terminal and run:
```bash
sudo xcodebuild -license
```
Follow the prompts to accept the license. Then verify Python:
```bash
python3 --version
```

### Option 2: Install Python via Homebrew

Open Terminal and run:
```bash
# Fix permissions
sudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/local/share/man/man3 /usr/local/share/man/man5 /usr/local/share/man/man7

# Install Python
brew install python@3.12

# Verify
python3 --version
```

### Option 3: Install Anaconda (Easiest)

1. Go to https://www.anaconda.com/download
2. Download Anaconda for macOS
3. Run the installer
4. Open a new Terminal
5. Type: `conda --version`

## Once Python is Working

After you have a working Python, come back and run:

```bash
cd /Users/corphd/Desktop/Or\ codes\ projects/OcrProject/DeepSeek-OCR

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio

# Run the project
cd DeepSeek-OCR-master/DeepSeek-OCR-hf
python run_dpsk_ocr.py
```

## Project Location

```
/Users/corphd/Desktop/Or codes projects/OcrProject/DeepSeek-OCR
```

## Why This Happened

Your system Python has dependencies on Xcode that haven't been configured. Installing a fresh Python via Homebrew or Anaconda will give you a clean environment that works immediately.

## Next Step

Choose one of the installation options above, run it in your Terminal, then come back here and we'll continue!
