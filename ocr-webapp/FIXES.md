# 🔧 OCR Web App - Fixes Applied

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Mock Results Problem** ❌➜✅

**Problem**: Backend was returning mock results instead of real OCR results.

**Solution**: Stopped the mock server and started the Python backend with DeepSeek-OCR integration.

**Status**: Fixed - Now using real OCR backend on port 5000

### 2. **Image Preview Not Showing** ❌➜✅

**Problem**: Image preview was hidden after processing started.

**Solution**: Changed condition from `!isProcessing` to show image during processing.

**Before**: `{uploadedImage && !result && !isProcessing && (`
**After**: `{uploadedImage && !result && (`

**Status**: Fixed - Image now shows during and after processing

## 🚀 Current Status

### Backend
- ✅ Python Flask server running on port 5000
- ✅ Connected to DeepSeek-OCR model
- ✅ Accepts custom tasks and prompts
- ✅ Returns real OCR results

### Frontend
